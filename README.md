## Development Workflow
Each user works on their assigned branch and follows a structured workflow to ensure smooth development and code review.
 
### Steps to Merge Your Task
1. **Create a sub-branch**
   - Name it after your task, e.g., `Task_86cy64u2e` (where `86cy64u2e` is your task ID from ClickUp).
 
2. **Commit your code**
   - Ensure commits are task-wise and meaningful.
 
3. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**
   - Open a PR against your main branch (e.g., `smit_s.main`).
 
4. **Assign a reviewer**
   - Add your mentor as a reviewer for the PR.
 
5. **Merge after approval**
   - Once your PR is approved, merge it into your assigned main branch (e.g., `smit_s.main`).
